    "Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., \"ace\" is a subsequence of \"abcde\" while \"aec\" is not).\n",

    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"abc\", t = \"ahbgdc\"\n",

    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"axc\", t = \"ahbgdc\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: false\n",

    "0 <= s.length <= 100\n",

    "0 <= t.length <= 104\n",

    "Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?"
